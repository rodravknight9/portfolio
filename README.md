# 3D Portfolio 
This is a 3D portfolio available in: https://roderknight.me

Building this website was inspired by Forrest Knight's 3D portfolio that actually has the "wow" factor indeed. I had much time wanting to build a personal website so here it is, it has some features I liked about many portfolios and web pages I've seen so far from people and friends that I admire. So here any employer can take a look to all projects I have been invloved as a Software Engineer. And yes, for the parallax effect it was tricky, specially in the way I cut the image, I hope any designer doesn't get offended by the work that I did with that, was my first time using Gimp. :/
